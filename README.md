As i am new to this technology i started with the que. "what is GO(GOLANG),GOFR and GORM?"
After taking the theoritical refrences from the artical->" https://medium.com/@mundhraumang.02?source=post_page-----0ea41eaa6c62--------------------------------  " and some other resources, I moved towords seeking some prectical implementations for that again i have to learn  not too much but basics of GO language such as "packages , variables, functions etc " here i found this resource really helpful and shows simplicity of codes-------->https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1<-----------.


-------------------------------------------------STAGE=2-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After taking some refrences now i setup the environment.
For that as newbie i downloaded a go env. which we have to setup with vs code.
But after some searching i get to know about GOLANG COMPILER.
Then i download the "go version go1.21.5 windows/amd64" which is GO IDE where i will get benifit with some inbuild functions.
Then check in my cmd ->1. go
                       2. go env
                       3. >go version
Now i am all set from the setup and for upcoming useful packages i will dowload as per the need.


------------------------------------------------STAGE=3-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now we will look after creating repository.
Then i clone that.
From now on github will be maintained parallelly, I will keep adding the basic structure, git add, git commit, git push and keep adding stages to readme file according to the progress to the projects.
