## Zopsmart-pro
# Step 1
As I am new to this technology i started with the que. "what is GO(GOLANG),GOFR and GORM?"
After taking the theoritical refrences from the artical->" https://medium.com/@mundhraumang.02?source=post_page-0ea41eaa6c62-  " and some other resources, I moved towords seeking some prectical implementations for that again i have to learn  not too much but basics of GO language such as packages , variables, functions etc.

# Step 2
The summarized steps based on our project 
1. Download and Install Go (https://golang.org/dl/)
2. Set Up Go Environment in VS Code
3. Install Golang Compiler
4. Check Go Installation(go version)


# Step 3
I set up the project by creating a database named 'cargarage' with a table called 'Cars.' Subsequently, I established a connection to this database. Moving forward, I developed the CRUD methods—'Get,' 'Update,' 'Delete,' and 'Create'—within the *store file.
